CODE ACADEMY OBJECTIVE 

Aisha's Greetings
You are a part of Aisha’s Greetings - a card printing company that prints greeting cards with a hint of personalization! You want to help Aisha create a system that generates cards based on customers’ requests.

You have been provided with two pre-filled card types:

happy_bday.txt: a card with a birthday message
thankyou_card.txt: a card file with a thank you message
Click through the files on your right and see what’s in them! If you get stuck, you can look at a sample solution of the project by looking at greetings_solutions.py - but try it out on your own first.

Let’s start printing!
